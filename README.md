# FrothFlotationModel
Predicting the effectiveness of a Froth floating process

# Project Description:

We will use this dataset to analyse and predict the Froth floating process having the two aims:

What is the best predictor for the iron concentration of the product?
Can the data set be used to predict the impurity of the product (by silicate concentration)?
# Data Description:

This propject deals with the analysis of a reverse cationic flotation process of a real production environment. 

# The Froth flotation process
The froth floatation is used to seperate the iron contents in the ore from other contaminations. The whole process usually contains for steps:

Contioning of the ore feed pulp (mixture of ore and water) and other reagents
Separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials: binding particles attach to the bubbles
The bubbles transport the particles upwards until they float on the surface (froth)
Collection of the froth by mechanical separation (e.g. by an impeller)
